In this paper, we investigate the first week of international newspaper coverage about the armored cruiser USS Maine explosion in Havana harbor on February 15, 1898. This event, in part, triggered the Spanish American War, which marked a changing of the imperial guards in the Western Hemisphere at the end of the nineteenth century. Using a selection of digitized newspapers from seven countries and employing statistical methods of quantitative analysis as well as close reading approaches, we take a new and comparative look at the initial coverage of the event from various national perspectives. Our research into the available newspaper data shows how editors molded the information that arrived via news agencies and other newspapers during the first week after the event into reports that added and reflected different biases concerning the explosion for specific national and regional audiences.
